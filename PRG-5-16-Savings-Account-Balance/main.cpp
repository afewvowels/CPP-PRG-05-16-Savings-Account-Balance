//
//  Write a program that calculates the balance of a savings account at the end of a period
//  of time. It should ask the user for the annual interest rate, the starting balance, and the
//  number of months that have passed since the account was established. A loop should
//  then iterate once for every month, performing the following:
//
//  A. Ask the user for the amount deposited into the account during the month. (Do not
//  accept negative numbers.) This amount should be added to the balance.
//  B. Ask the user for the amount withdrawn from the account during the month. (Do
//  not accept negative numbers.) This amount should be subtracted from the balance.
//  C. Calculate the monthly interest. The monthly interest rate is the annual interest rate
//  divided by 12. Multiply the monthly interest rate by the balance, and add the result
//  to the balance.
//
//  After the last iteration, the program should display the ending balance, the total
//  amount of deposits, the total amount of withdrawals, and the total interest earned.
